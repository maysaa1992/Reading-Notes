## 2-From the “6 tips to ace a whiteboard programming interview” article, can you identify and explain at least two strategies that can help improve your performance during a whiteboard programming interview?

1- Take a few minutes. Speaking as an interview coach, this is one misstep that I see all the time during mock interviews. The canonical tip that everyone gives is, “talk more!”. What most of those well-meaning advice-givers overlook, however, is that talking and thinking at the same time is extremely hard. Nervous interviewees will jump straight into talking, passing up a great opportunity for concentrated thought.

2- Write down the steps of the solution. Even after you have an idea of how to attack the problem, don’t start writing code down. Write down the general steps of how you will solve it on one side of the whiteboard, where it’s visible but won’t get in the way. You don’t need to be verbose, just get the steps in order and somewhat readable

## 3-What does Gayle McDowell say about interview preparation in the Engineering Interview Process Deconstructed video?

That candidates are chosen based on the way they solve a problem, not the time it took them to solve the problem.

Be more comfortable with the basics, data structures and algorithms

The purpose of the interview is to make the candidate solve a problem that they haven’t solved before and to see how they deal with hard problems
