# Reading Questions


**1-In the context of the reading “Pain and Suffering,” describe the main challenges faced by beginners when learning Python and suggest at least two strategies for overcoming these obstacles.**


**-Decide what to write ->** For new programmers, this can be a challenge. You have to be super detail oriented, as every single word that you write in the code will make it perform in a certain way. Plus, for every word you add, the chances of making an error increase.

However, Python does try and help newbies with this challenge. How? By providing a feature which will help you to auto-complete the code. Python also includes a facility which sets the data types of variables, which should make your life easier.


**-Name clashing with Python Standard Library Modules**


with all of these library modules it can be surprisingly easy to run into a name clash between the name of one of your own modules, and one of modules in the standard library that comes with Python.



**2-After reading “Beginners Guide to Big O,” explain the concept of time complexity and space complexity.**

Big O notation is used in computer science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used by an algorithm. It is hard to pin down the exact runtime required by an algorithm, it depends on what processor you use, what other programs the computer is running. So instead of calculating that, we use a concept to see how quickly the runtime grows. Imagine when we write a piece of code, we would more likely end up in refactoring it not just because we want to keep the application DRY, but we want to make sure the efficiency of our code, which is directly related to user experience.

**3-Based on the “Names and Values in Python” reading, explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types in Python.**


**mutable:** an object that allows you to change its values without changing its identity is a mutable object.

**immutable:** doesn't allow any change in the object once it has been created.
