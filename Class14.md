# Reading Questions
## 1- What are the key differences between Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh libraries in terms of their features and use cases? Provide an example of a specific visualization that is more suitable for each library.

**Matplotlib:**

Versatile, low-level plotting library.
Provides fine-grained control and customization.
Suitable for creating basic and complex static visualizations.


**Seaborn:**

Higher-level library built on Matplotlib.
Offers aesthetically pleasing statistical graphics.
Ideal for exploring statistical relationships and handling categorical data.


**Bokeh:**

Designed for interactive visualization.
Supports web-based, interactive plots.
Well-suited for creating dashboards and exploring large datasets.


## 2-In the Seaborn library, what are the main functions to create relational, categorical, and distribution plots? Briefly explain the purpose of each type of plot and provide an example use case.

Relational plots: scatterplot(), lineplot(), relplot() purpose: show the relationship between two variables example use case: scatter plot showing the correlation between two variables

Categorical plots: catplot(), boxplot(), violinplot() purpose: show the distribution of a variable within categories example use case: box plot showing the distribution of a variable within categories

 

## 3-Discuss the role of the Seaborn Cheat Sheet in a Python developerâ€™s workflow. What are some key sections or elements featured in the cheat sheet that can help a developer quickly reference Seaborn functionalities?

The Seaborn Cheat Sheet serves as a quick reference guide for Python developers using Seaborn. It contains key sections and elements that provide a summary of Seaborn functionalities:
 

Plotting Functions: The cheat sheet lists the main plotting functions available in Seaborn, organized by plot type (e.g., categorical, distribution) and briefly describes their purpose.
