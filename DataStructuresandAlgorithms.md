+ **What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem**                            no single data structure serves as an optimal solution for all problems. to pick the best data structure to solve a particular problem, we have to take into account what are the operations we are going to perform and how often they are going to be executed
+ **How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?**                                                                                                            made toward the basis case or cases in every recursive call. 
+ **Recursion:** a computer programming technique involving the use of a procedure, subroutine, function, or algorithm that calls itself one or more times until a specified condition is met at which time the rest of each repetition is processed from the last one called to the first.
+ **Recursion has two case:** 1-Base case 2-Recursive case 
+ **pseudocode:** high-level description of the problem you are tring to solve in code its written like code but its meant to be closer to human speech         
 + **data structure:** is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data. There are several basic and advanced types of data structures, all designed to arrange data to suit a specific purpose. Data structures make it easy for users to access 
+ **types  of Data Structures:**                                                 **-linked list:** data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers             
 **-Hashing table:** is a technique or process of mapping keys, and values into the hash table by using a hash function.                        
  **-Stack:** is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).                                                      **-Queue:** is defined as a linear data structure that is open at both ends and the operations are performed in First In First Out (FIFO) order.
  
**Big O:** is essentially an equation that describes how the runtime scales with respect to some input variables
