## 1-Can you explain the basic concept of linear regression and its purpose in the context of machine learning and data analysis?

Linear regression is one of the easiest and most popular Machine Learning algorithms. It is a statistical method that is used for predictive analysis. Linear regression makes predictions for continuous/real or numeric variables such as sales, salary, age, product price, etc.

## 2-Describe the process of implementing a linear regression model using Python’s Scikit Learn library, including the necessary steps and functions.

Scikit-learn is a Python package that makes it easier to apply a variety of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for predictive data analysis, such as linear regression.

Linear regression is defined as the process of determining the straight line that best fits a set of dispersed data points:

The line can then be projected to forecast fresh data points. Because of its simplicity and essential features, linear regression is a fundamental Machine Learning method.

## 3-What is the purpose of splitting the dataset into train and test sets, and how does this contribute to the evaluation of a machine learning model’s performance?


In machine learning, data splitting is typically done to avoid overfitting. That is an instance where a machine learning model fits its training data too well and fails to reliably fit additional data. The original data in a machine learning model is typically taken and split into three or four sets
